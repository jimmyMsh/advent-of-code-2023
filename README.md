# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges.

## Structure

Each day's solutions are in separate files named according to the day and part (e.g., `day1_part1.py` for the first part of Day 1).

## Objective

The main objective is to improve my programming and problem-solving skills.

## How to Use

- Each file contains solutions that can be run to see the outputs for the given inputs.
- Inputs are stored separately in files or directories as required.
